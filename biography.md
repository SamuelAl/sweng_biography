## Introduction

Jeffrey Adgate Dean is a prominent American computer scientist and software engineer. Admirers of his work colloquially refer to him as the *Chuck Norris of Software Engineering* or as the *Programming God* [include citations]. His contributions span numerous fields, including systemÂ´s infrastructure, distributed and parallel systems, database systems and most lately AI. While most of his work has been accomplished working for the company Google, his contributions have often proven seminal in their respective fields and have influenced the way global systems such as the internet infrastructure are build, or how AI is developed in the industry. 

As a student of computer science and a budding software engineer, I greatly admire the work of Jeff Dean. His passion, rigour, search for efficiency and speed, and enthusiasm for hard engineering problems, have always been an inspiration for me in my journey. It is a testament to the fact that no problem is immune to a proper engineering approach, and that true transformations can often lie hidden in the details and robustness of a well-designed system. As I continue my exploits in the world of computer science and software engineer, I look forward to tackling bigger and more complex problems with the same hunger and confidence Jeff Dean demonstrates in all his work.
