## Introduction

Jeffrey Adgate Dean is a prominent American computer scientist and software engineer. Admirers of his work colloquially refer to him as the *Chuck Norris of Software Engineering* or as the *Programming God* [include citations]. His contributions span numerous fields, including system´s infrastructure, distributed and parallel systems, database systems and most lately AI. While most of his work has been accomplished working for the company Google, his contributions have often proven seminal in their respective fields and have influenced the way global systems such as the internet infrastructure are build, or how AI is developed in the industry. 

As a student of computer science and a budding software engineer, I greatly admire the work of Jeff Dean. His passion, rigour, search for efficiency and speed, and enthusiasm for hard engineering problems, have always been an inspiration for me in my journey. It is a testament to the fact that no problem is immune to a proper engineering approach, and that true transformations can often lie hidden in the details and robustness of a well-designed system. As I continue my exploits in the world of computer science and software engineer, I look forward to tackling bigger and more complex problems with the same hunger and confidence Jeff Dean demonstrates in all his work.

## Beginnings

Jeff Dean was born Jeffrey Adgate Dean on July 23, 1968, Hawaii. His parents, Andy and Virginia, both had academic backgrounds, albeit not in computer science, a nascent field back then. Andy was a tropical disease researcher, and Virginia a medical anthropologist. Jeff had early contact with computers, as opposed to some of his closest collaborators such as Sanjay Ghemawat. As a hobby, he and his father gradually built and programmed a IMSAI 8080 kit computer from scratch. These early experiences would be crucial on his later career, as Jeff often expressed a fascination with the low level details of computer systems, very close to the physical level, as opposed to the high level abstractions programmers often preferred. It is this attention to detail that will distinguish him from his peers later on in his career, as we will see.

 His family moved often and took part in a series of humanitarian projects, such as aid in a Somalian refugee camp when Jeff was only 13. This, together with his father´s work, was probably the inspiration for his first serious project, Epic Info, an epidemiology data collection tool which he wrote while still in high school. The software was so fast and robust given the current technology that it was subsequently adopted in the field and became a standard tool. It was such an influential advancement that the CDCP (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) still maintains a website on the project, including a high school picture of the young Jeff Dean. 

 After high school, Jeff Dean went on to study Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. It is here that he met his wife, Heidi Hopper. After finishing his undergraduate studies, he obtained a Ph.D in Computer Science at the University of Washington, with Craig Chambers as his supervisor. His thesis was titled *Whole-program optimization techniques for object-oriented programming languages*, and was focused on compiler optimization. Again, this points towards his later exploits in optimization of highly scalable systems.

## Early Career

After completing his education, Jeff started working at DEC/Compaq Western Research Laboratories. Quite a few employees of this laboratory would end up joining the early ranks of Google. It was here that Jeff met Sanjay, arguably his closest collaborator. Jeff and Sanjay are known practitioners of the *pair programming* technique, and they continued using this approach at Google.

 It was with Sanjay Ghemawat that Jeff undertook most of his work at DEC. This focused mainly on microprocessor architecture and profiling tools. It was his experience with profiling tools and the low-level workings of processors that enabled him to implement the highly optimized and scalable solutions he later became famous for.
